                This depends very much on where people live and how old they are, with some parts of the world hit
                harder
                than others, and some age groups being affected more, such as older people. However, even in countries
                where
                the COVID-19 death rate seems relatively low, the indirect impact on reduced health services, vaccine
                supply
                shortages, and reluctance to seek medical treatment for fear of infection is having a drastic impact and
                putting tens of millions of people at risk – including children and newborns.

                COVID-19 has a higher rate of severe disease and mortality in nearly every age group, compared with
                influenza (flu).

        <p>
            <b>
                Mask wearing is a very simple and effective way to reduce transmission and save lives. The degree of
                protection depends on the type of mask, how well they worn and on other factors such as the behaviour of
                people wearing them and the behaviour of air droplets in different settings.

                Ensuring COVID-19 vaccines reach people in the world’s poorest countries isn’t just about being
                charitable
                or acting on a moral imperative; it’s also in the best interest of every country to do so. The pandemic
                started in Wuhan, China and spread to 180 countries within three months. That means if the virus is
                circulating in one country, the rest of the world remains at risk.

            <b>
                COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and produced in record time, but it’s also involved unprecedented
                levels of funding and global cooperation to tackle a global threat. So far, all approved COVID-19
                vaccines
                have undergone large clinical trials with rigorous safety protocols, and without major safety concerns
                raised.
