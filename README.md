## How Is This Any Different From Other Websites/Applications : 
This website is developed in order to target the audience with the least privilages given , in our case we have decided to focus on the elderly through giving them special
permissions that other regular users do not have , and it will be designed in order to be able to co-operate under specific covid-19 updates , for example whenever the numbers
people affected with covid-19 virus has grown bigger , the time gaps between each appointment will be increased according to the vaccination station in the city and according to
the color of the city , another feature that was added in order to help the elderly get vaccinated and increase the number of the old audience that have been vaccinated is the
ability to get vaccinated at home because they might face certain difficulities whilst trying to set an appointment / go to an appointment , alongside those priviliges we have 
added and will be adding many features like the ability to report multiple incidents that are related to covid-19 ,  the ability to read articles while in the process of browsing
the website , and many other intresting features alongside .
for the log-in system we are using a two factor authentication using the email address the person provides in order to confirm and activate the user's account .
